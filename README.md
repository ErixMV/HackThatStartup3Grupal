## Starting the project

Clone the repository

```sh
npm clone
```

Install the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

Make sure to create your own environment file in src/config folder. There is a sample.env, copy it and use your own variables.



Start in development mode: (Server on watch mode)
```sh
npm start
```

## Testing Environment
The project testing is done using ``Jest`` and ``Supertest`` modules. 

When the testing environment is running, Jest cannot read .env files with `env-cmd` module. For that reason, the enviroment variables are served by a JavaScript file in .jest folder. There is a sample that needs to have the asked variables.

Then, the test environment can be run.
```sh
npm test
```

## Folders structure
All the typescript code is in src folder.
| Folder / File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|    *api*    |   All business logic and model handlers.     | 
|    *app*    |   Express server configuration  (DB, HELMET, ...).  | 
|    *bin*    |   Server Port configuration. | 
|    *config*    |   Environment variables depending on server status (dev, prod, test, ...).     | 
|    *graphql*    |   GraphQL Api files (schema, types, resolvers,...).     | 
|    *routes*    |   Main route file for app server     | 
|    *scripts*    |  Isolated functions      | 
|    *tests*    |   Testing functions    | 
|    app.js   |   Server declaration and configuration      |

## NPM scripts

Compiler to high compability JavaScript version
```sh
npm run build
```

Server on development mode (ES6 or later).
```sh
npm start
```

Start high compability server
```sh
npm run serve
```

Delete compiled JavaScript code
```sh
npm run clean
```

Start test environment
```sh
npm test
```

Force heroku to run npm build before the start
```sh
npm run heroku-postbuild
```

## Models routing
All the routes are defined following REST convention.
### User

## GraphQL
The GraphQL API is an addition, can interact with the models and make requests to database.

*The setup is done but some implementations are missing for now*
